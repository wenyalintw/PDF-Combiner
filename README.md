# PDF-Combiner
## Introduction
Tired of opening online-pdf-combiner to combine PDF files.

## Installation
Use [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) to build standalone executable.
> The one in repo was build under macOS High Sierra v10.13.6

## Usage
Run the command followed by bunch of PDF files to be combined

```bash
pdf-combine 1.pdf 2.pdf 3.pdf ...
```
than `combined.pdf` will generate at current directory  
> Note: Drag files into terminal will save lots of time

## Postscript
Just found out I got [PDFjam](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/firth/software/pdfjam/) installed few seconds before git push LOL.
